            <strong>HTML</strong>, is an acronym which stands for <strong>Hyper Text Markup Language</strong> which is used for creating web pages and web applications. Let's see what is meant by Hyper Text Markup Language, and Web page.
          </p><br/>
  
          <p>
            <strong>Hyper Text:</strong> Simply means "Text Within Text." A text has a link within it, is a hypertext. Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new web page, you have clicked on a hyper text. Hyper Text is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.
          </p><br/>
  
          <p>
            <strong>Markup Language</strong>, A markup language, is a computer language that is used to apply layout and formatting conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into images, tables, links, etc.
          </p>
          <br />
  
          <p>
            <strong>Web Page</strong>, A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated by a web browser. A web page can be identified by entering an URL. A web page can be of the static or dynamic type.
            <strong>
              With the help of HTML only, we can create static web pages.
            </strong
            >.
          </p><br/>
  
          <p>
            Hence, HTML is a markup language which is used for creating attractive web pages with the help of styling, and which looks in a nice format on a web browser. An HTML document is made of many HTML tags and each HTML tag contains diferent content.

          <h2>Brief History of HTML</h2>
  
          <p>
            In the late 1980's, a physicist, <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong> who was a contractor at CERN, proposed a system for "CERN" researchers". in 1989, he wrote a memo proposing an internet based hypertext system.
          </p><br/>
  
          <p>
            <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong> is known as the father of HTML. The first avaliable description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags" proposed by Tim in the late 1991. The latest version of HTML is HTML5. which we will learn later in this course.
